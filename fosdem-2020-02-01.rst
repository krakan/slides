Day 1
=====

* 2020-02-01

How Containers and Kubernetes re-defined GNU/Linux
==================================================

* Cloud computing with vertical lock-in is undermining software freedom
* But Docker and Kubernetes is changing the way we deliver software
* Docker for packaging
* Kubernetes for orchestration
* Kubernetes Operators for full service delivery

Fixing the Kubernetes clusterfuck
=================================

* Falco - Wireshark for kernel packages
* Built on top on IPF
* Can monitor and prevent malicious behaviour
* Demo - privilege escalation in Kubernetes

Google vs Oracle
================

* US Supreme Court case about Java2 SE in Android

* Google took a bunch of declarations

  - there is only one way to do this so copyright can't cover that
  - it's fair use

* Oracle

  - the API is a creative literary work
  - fair use is not allowed to displace market shares

* Google won twice in district court and lost twice in appellate court
* Supreme Court Final decision in June

Identity box
============

* Public key â‰ˆ identity but not enough
* A decentralized ID resolver must be built on a decentralized network
* A decentralized network need static nodes
* Identity Box is a small device that can be such a node
* It can also handle one or more Self-sovereign ID:s

SCION
=====

* People often try to solve internet on top of internet
* Routing is hard
* SCION has decentralized routing
* The end host defines the path
* It can coexist with IP
* **S**\calability, **C**\ontrol and **I**\solation on next-generati **O**\n **N**\etworks

Pulumi
======

* Orchestrating Cloud infrastructure is complex
* Using YAML doesn't make it less so
* Programming languages are better at handling complexity
* Pulumi is a cross cloud **infrastructure as code** tool
* It supports Node and Python
* and .NET and Go in beta

.. class:: illustration

Nomad
=====

* Container orchestration without the K8s complexity
* Only cluster management and scheduling
* Add other components as needed

  - service discovery
  - monitoring
  - secrets management
  - ...

* By HashiCorp
